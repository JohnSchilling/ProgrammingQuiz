  answer: If Then Statement
  numCorrect: 1
  question: This kind of logic statement checks whether a variable is in a given state
    and then executes some operation. If the variable isn't in the state the statement
    is checking it will either execute some other operation or do nothing.
- alternatives:
  - Do While Loop
  - For Each Loop
  - If Then Statement
  answer: For Loop
  numCorrect: 2
  question: This kind of logic statement will perform the same operation over and
    over. A given numeric value will either be increasing or decreasing each time
    the loop runs until a given value is reached and your program exits the loop.
- alternatives:
  - Do While Loop
  - Array
  - If Then Statement
  answer: For Each Loop
  numCorrect: 1
  question: This kind of logic statement is used to step through all of the items
    contained in a list, array, or more complex but similarly structured data object.
    For each item contained in the data object the loop will execute some logic until
    it has touched every item in the data object.
- alternatives:
  - For Loop
  - For Each Loop
  - If Then Statement
  answer: While Loop
  numCorrect: 0
  question: This kind of logic statement will perform an operation until the statement
    that initiated the loop is no-longer valid. If the initial statement is not true
    none of the code contained within will run.
- alternatives:
  - For Loop
  - For Each Loop
  - If Then Statement
  answer: Do While Loop
  numCorrect: 0
  question: This kind of logic statement will execute at least once before checking
    to see if the while condition is true or not. If the while condition is still
    valid after the initial code execution it will continue to execute until the while
    condition is no-longer true.

  answer: Function

  question: Refers to a group of instructions usually given a specific name so that
    they can then be referenced elsewhere in your application. Functions can be anonymous
    (meaning they do not have a specific name to allow them be referenced later) but
    this means they have to be used during the applications run time and that they
    cannot be referenced elsewhere in your program.

  question: This refers to the values that are passed to a function when you call
    it.
- alternatives:
  - Class
  - Object Oriented Programming
  - Inheritance
  answer: Procedural Programming
  numCorrect: 0
  question: Is a top down approach to writing a program. Any variable or function
    value that is called by your application must have already been created and or
    populated further up your application. The format of a program written this way
    is similar to how a traditional novel would be written with all of the necessary
    plot points and characters fleshed out before they are referenced later in the
    text.

  - Procedural Programming
  - Object Oriented Programming
  - Inheritance
  answer: Class
  numCorrect: 0
  question: A core building block in Object Oriented Programming, they define all
    of the values and functions of a given object. For instance the car class would
    contain within it functions that defined things like doors, wheels, and engine
    types and variables that contained fixed values like wheel, seat, or cupholder.

  question: A style of programming that allows functions and variables to be called
    from anywhere within the entire application and for the values returned by those
    variables or functions to be changed. This style of programming allows code written
    once to be reused throughout the rest of the application.
- alternatives:
  - Algorithm
  - Array
  - Arguments
  answer: Constructor
  numCorrect: 1
  question: This is any call that creates a new instance of an Object or Class. The
    keyword new is placed in front of the name of the Object or Class to indicate
    this is a new instance of it. In Python for instance this is the __init__ function
    you will often see referenced as the first function in a class.

  answer: Deconstructor

  question: This is sometimes called at the end of class to remove from memory or
    clear any variable values you do not want to store for later use. These are often
    called automatically by the programming language.
